## Newly broken

*   checking whether startup messages can be suppressed ... NOTE
     ```
     duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
     ℹ /tmp/RtmpLzWhWU/working_dir/RtmpXAzg4D/duckdb
     This is removed when the R session ends.
     • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
     • Secrets are lost.
     ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
     ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
     ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
     
     It looks like this package (or a package it requires) has a startup
     message which cannot be suppressed: see ?packageStartupMessage.
     ```

## In both

*   checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE
     ```
       Missing dependency on R >= 4.2.0 because package code uses the pipe
       placeholder syntax added in R 4.2.0.
       File(s) using such syntax:
         ‘cosinor-constructor.R’
     ```
